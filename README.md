# Swarmalators-under-competitive-time-varying-phase-interactions
This is Fortran code for generating the data of scatter plots of the swarmalators and matlab code for plotting the scatter plots in Fig.2, Fig.4 (a), and Fig.7.
Figure4a.gif shows the formation of a static cluster sync state. Figure6.gif illustrates the formation of static pi state. Figure7a.gif-Figure7e.gif show the formation of mixed phase wave states. For reference please see the article "Swarmalators under competitive time-varying phase
interactions" by Gourab K. Sar, Sayantan Nag Chowdhury, Matja≈æ Perc, and Dibakar Ghosh.
